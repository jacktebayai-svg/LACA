Master Aesthetics Suite

Complete UX/UI Design Manual
Version 1.0 – “Elegant Noir” Old Money Edition
I. Brand Experience Philosophy

This is not a “pretty website.” It is an experience that must exude heritage wealth, exclusivity, and refined luxury at every interaction.

    Mood: Private members club meets contemporary aesthetics institute

    Pacing: Calm, deliberate — no flashy gimmicks

    Feel: Thick, confident, generous whitespace and typography spacing

    Interaction Personality: Every animation should feel like a butler sliding a crystal decanter into view — smooth, precise, unhurried

II. Core Brand Tokens
Color Palette (no deviations allowed)
Role	Hex	Usage
Primary Noir	#1A1A1A	Backgrounds, hero blocks, nav bars
Deep Charcoal	#2B2B2B	Secondary panels, dashboard sidebars
Champagne Gold	#C5A880	Primary accents, buttons, active states
Champagne Highlight	#D4B97A	Hover states, subtle gradients
Ivory White	#FFFFFF	Headline text
Soft Mist Grey	#E0E0E0	Body text
Estate Border Grey	#333333	Borders and separators

Gradients: Only subtle noir-to-charcoal linear gradients (angle 180°, opacity shift max 8%) — no diagonal gradients.
Shadows: Must be soft and feathered; never harsh. Example: 0px 8px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4).
Typography

    Primary Typeface: Inter (variable font, weight 300–700 only)

    Headings: Uppercase allowed only for navigation & labels, never body copy

    Hierarchy:

        H1: 48px / weight 700 / letter-spacing -0.5px

        H2: 36px / weight 600 / letter-spacing -0.25px

        H3: 28px / weight 500

        Body Large: 18px / weight 400

        Body Regular: 16px / weight 400

        Body Small: 14px / weight 400

Line Heights: Always generous — at least 1.4 for headings, 1.6 for body.
III. Layout Principles
Grid

    12-column fluid grid with fixed gutter (24px desktop, 16px mobile)

    Max container width: 1440px

    Mobile-first — design collapses gracefully to 1-column flow

Whitespace Rules

    Minimum top/bottom section padding: 96px desktop, 48px mobile

    Side padding: always ≥ gutter width

    Between unrelated components: 64px desktop, 32px mobile

Hierarchy

    Above the fold: no more than 1 hero + 1 call-to-action

    Use progressive disclosure — never show every detail at once; reveal in layers

IV. Components
Buttons

    Primary: Champagne gold fill, white text, rounded-lg (24px), shadow subtle gold hue

    Secondary: Transparent with 2px gold border

    Hover: Gold brightens (#D4B97A), slight 1.02 scale, shadow deepens

    Press: Instant scale-down to 0.98, shadow retracts, returns on release

    Disabled: Opacity 0.4, cursor not-allowed, no hover

Inputs

    Minimal noir background, 1px grey border

    Focus: Border and glow in champagne gold, 0.3s transition

    Placeholder text in estate grey (#AAAAAA)

    Error: Border in muted burgundy (#8B2F2F), inline error text small and italic

Cards

    Service Cards:

        Image top, overlaid gold label (top-left)

        Bottom section: Service name in bold white, price in gold

        Hover: Image dims by 8%, gold overlay fade-in with CTA

Navigation

    Transparent on hero

    Solid noir background after 80px scroll

    Active link underlined with 2px gold bar, transitions in 0.4s

    Dropdown menus: Fade + slide down 8px with slight delay

Booking Flow

    Step-by-step — never all in one view

    Progress indicator with numbered gold circles connected by thin grey lines

    Date picker: Gold underline on selected day, subtle fade on hover

    Time slots: Gold pill buttons, disabled slots 50% opacity

Dashboard

    Sidebar: Deep charcoal, icons gold when active

    Main area: White text on noir cards, gold highlight for metrics

    Cards: Rounded corners 24px, shadow minimal, padding 24px

V. Microinteraction Rules

    Hover effects: Never bounce, always glide

    Transitions: Use ease-in-out for calmness, never ease-out alone

    Delays: Elements fade in with staggered 50ms difference

    Scroll: Parallax background layers move at 15% speed difference

VI. Motion System

    All animations via Framer Motion

    Preset durations:

        Microinteractions: 0.15–0.3s

        Page transitions: 0.6s fade

        Modal open: 0.4s upward slide + fade

VII. Asset Handling

    Images: WebP with max width 1440px, always retina-ready (2x)

    Icons: Lucide-react set, recolored in gold via CSS variables

    Fonts: Preloaded primary weights (400, 500, 700)

VIII. Accessibility

    All gold on noir text must meet 4.5:1 contrast

    Focus outline: 2px solid gold for all interactive elements

    Screen reader labels for all icons

    Form errors announced via ARIA live regions

X. Designer’s Commandments

    Never use drop shadows without soft blur and correct opacity.

    Gold is precious — do not flood backgrounds with it; use sparingly.

    If it feels “fast,” slow it down by 20%.

    Text must breathe — never crowd elements.

    Every click, scroll, or hover should feel like silk being drawn over glass.
